          <p>On this website, third-party and own cookies are used to provide you with a better browsing experience, enable you to share content on social media, and gather user statistics.</p>
          <p>You can prevent the downloading of cookies by adjusting your browser settings to block the storage of cookies on your device.</p>
          <p>As the owner of this website, I inform you that we do not use any personally identifiable information from cookies; we only gather general visit statistics that do not contain any personal information.</p>
          <p>It is important that you read this cookie policy and understand that by continuing to browse, we will consider that you accept the use of cookies.</p>
          <p>According to the terms stated in Article 22.2 of Law 34/2002 on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, by continuing to browse, you are giving your consent to the use of these mechanisms.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">Data Controller</p>
          <p>The entity responsible for the collection, processing, and use of your personal data, as defined by the Personal Data Protection Law, is the Miami Scaffold Rental website, owned by Joe Russo â€“ 9955 NW 116th Way, Ste. 8 Medley, FL 33178.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">What are cookies?</p>
          <p>Cookies are sets of data that a server deposits in a user's browser to collect standard Internet registration information and visitor behavior information on a website. In other words, they are small text files that are stored on the computer's hard drive and serve to identify the user when they connect to the website again. Their purpose is to record the user's visit and store certain information. Their use is common and frequent on the web as it allows pages to function more efficiently and provides greater personalization and analysis of user behavior.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">What types of cookies exist?</p>
          <p>The cookies used on our website are session and third-party cookies. They allow us to store and access information about the language, type of browser used, and other general user-defined characteristics. They also allow us to track and analyze user activity in order to introduce improvements and provide our services more efficiently and personalized.</p>
          <p>Cookies can be divided into session or persistent cookies, depending on their duration. Session cookies expire when the user closes the browser, while persistent cookies expire based on when their purpose is fulfilled (for example, to keep the user identified in Joe Russo's services) or when they are manually deleted.</p>

          <p>Additionally, based on their purpose, cookies can be classified as follows:</p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Performance cookies</p>
          <p>This type of cookie remembers your preferences for tools found on the services, so you don't have to reconfigure the service every time you visit. Examples include volume settings for video or audio players, video streaming speeds compatible with your browser, and items saved in the shopping cart in e-commerce services such as stores.</p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Geolocation cookies</p>
          <p>These cookies are used to determine the country where you are located when a service is requested. This cookie is completely anonymous and is only used to help target content to your location.</p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Registration cookies</p>
          <p>Registration cookies are generated once the user has registered or subsequently logged into their account. They are used to identify the user in the services for the following purposes:</p>
          <p>Maintain user identification so that if they close a service, browser, or computer and later re-enter the service at another time or on another day, they will remain identified, facilitating navigation without having to log in again. This functionality can be eliminated if the user clicks the "log out" function, in which case this cookie is deleted, and the next time the user enters the service, they will have to log in to be identified.</p>
          <p>Check if the user is authorized to access certain services, for example, to participate in a contest.</p>
          <p>Additionally, some services may use connectors with social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. When the user registers for a service using credentials from a social network, they authorize the social network to save a persistent cookie that remembers their identity and guarantees access to the services until it expires. The user can delete this cookie and revoke access to the services through social networks by updating their preferences on the specific social network.</p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Analytics cookies</p>
          <p>Each time a user visits a service, an external provider's analytical tool generates an analytical cookie on the user's computer. This cookie, which is only generated during the visit, will serve in future visits to Joe Russo's services to anonymously identify the visitor. The main objectives pursued are:</p>
          <p>Enable anonymous identification of browsing users through the cookie (identifying browsers and devices, not individuals) and therefore provide approximate visitor counts and trends over time.</p>
          <p>Anonymously identify the most visited content and, therefore, the most attractive content for users. Determine if the user accessing the content is new or a repeat visitor.</p>
          <p>Important: Unless the user decides to register for a Joe Russo service, the cookie will never be associated with any personal data that can identify them. Such cookies will only be used for statistical purposes to help optimize the user experience on the site.</p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Advertising cookies</p>
          <p>This type of cookies allows for expanding the information of the ads shown to each anonymous user in Joe Russo's services. Among other things, it stores the duration or frequency of display of advertising positions, interaction with them, and browsing patterns and/or user behavior since they help create a profile of advertising interests. This allows offering advertising related to the user's interests.</p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Third-party advertising cookies</p>
          <p>In addition to the advertising managed by Joe Russo's websites in its services, Joe Russo's websites offer advertisers the option to serve ads through third parties ("Ad-Servers"). Thus, these third parties can store cookies sent from Joe Russo's services in users' browsers and access the data stored in them.</p>
          <p>The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies. Currently, Joe Russo's websites use the DoubleClick (Google) platform to manage these services. For more information, visit:</p>

          <p class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">How can I disable cookies in my browser?</p>
          <p>Different browsers can be configured to notify the user of the reception of cookies and, if desired, prevent their installation on the device. Likewise, the user can review the cookies installed in their browser and their expiration date, as well as delete them.</p>
